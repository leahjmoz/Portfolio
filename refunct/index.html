    <template id="text-template-title"><strike>Abstract</strike> The Defunct and the Rebranded</template>

    <template id="text-template-1">
      The evolving role of branding in modern Formula 1 <strike>reveals that</strike> has made identity and cultural relevance just as crucial as race results and legacy for a team's survival. As the sport's audience grows and diversifies, especially with younger, socially aware fans, <strike>teams are expected to represent more than performance</strike> teams must have brands that resonate beyond the track <strike>identities rooted in</strike>, embracing values like authenticity and inclusivity. Case studies of <strike>failed teams</strike> defunct teams, successful rebrands, and entirely new teams, examines how branding strategies shape fan loyalty and longevity in a fast paced sport.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-2">
      Without a strong identity, even longstanding teams can lose ground without a brand that connects to modern culture, while newer or reimagined teams find success <strike>reflecting the values of today's audience</strike> by connecting with fans through modern narratives and values. The format of the writing reflects this theme too, certain lines are intentionally crossed out to mirror the <strike>instability and impermanence</strike> concept of revision and reinvention faced by defunct teams and outdated ideas. Together, these elements explore how Formula 1 teams <strike>can evolve not only on track</strike> can redefine themselves with their stories mattering just as much as the races.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-title-2"><strike>Introduction</strike> Branding Becomes Survival</template>

    <template id="text-template-3">
      <strike>For years Formula 1 has been a sport based on speed</strike> Legacy used to be built solely on achievement. Now, perception has just as much of a hand in the construction. In a sport like Formula 1 where <strike>old meets new</strike> tradition means innovation constantly, the <strike>goal</strike> question isn't only who <strike>wins</strike> crosses the finish line first, but who <strike>stays relevant</strike><strike>catches the spotlight</strike> <strike>has the best social media</strike> is capturing the attention of the fans₁. Behind every team on the grid is a brand, some a symbol of national pride, and others <strike>dominated by</strike> led by corporate influence. But in a sport where performance dictates profit, <strike>some teams failed to adapt</strike> many teams have to call it quits when they don't meet expectations. <strike>Falling behind not just in performance but in relevance.</strike> Poor results quickly lead to sponsors pulling out and <strike>money running dry</strike> financial pressure that pushes them off the grid. Defunct teams like these are replaced or forgotten in the fast paced sport₂.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-4">
      Other teams, however, avoid this short lifespan with a <strike>rebrand</strike> transformation. New owners, new sponsors, or just <strike>a perception shift</strike> adapting their image allow teams to endure. While rebrands can end up being <strike>ineffective</strike> unlasting, some teams <strike>with a</strike> <strike>longer lineage can capitalize on continuity, using historical success and fan loyalty </strike><strike>as part of their image</strike> manage to draw on the historical connection of the previous team and gain loyalty from a very traditional fan base. <strike>Branding in Formula 1 has</strike> <strike> evolved from simple logos to carefully curated narratives.</strike> In contrast, frequently rebranded or new teams <strike>start from nothing</strike> face the challenge of building their image from the ground up. <strike>Branding has to be dynamic</strike> As Formula 1 expands into new markets, branding is adapting to <strike>more female</strike> <strike>more American</strike> <strike>younger</strike> more diverse audiences₃. The branding is a calculated effort to stay culturally relevant in <strike>a time shaped by</strike> a world run on engagement, and commercially viable in order to keep sponsorships in a sport running on funding.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-5">
      The emergence of projects like <strike>the entry of</strike> Cadillacᶠᶦᵍ¹ joining the grid as an American team and <strike>VCARB</strike> the Racing Bullᶠᶦᵍ² team's energetic social media presence suggests a shift in how branding is being approached. <strike>Sticking less to tradition</strike> No longer so adherent to tradition, teams are pushing a more <strike>flexible</strike> forward facing image. Similarly, initiatives like the all female series, F1 Academyᶠᶦᵍ³, bring new support reach to team branding. F1 teams <strike>aligning themselves with</strike> sponsoring female drivers, <strike>pushes their values of</strike> displays their values of inclusion, youth development, and diversity to their brand. Looking at how F1 teams <strike>brand, rebrand, or disappear</strike> rise, fall, and reinvent, <strike>reveals how business and culture shape the world of F1</strike> shows the commercial pressures and cultural shifts that define the sport in the modern era.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-title-3"><strike>Chapter 1</strike> Lack of Legacy</template>

    <template id="text-template-6">
      In Formula 1, a team's identity <strike>is not defined only by its performance</strike> extends beyond the track. Their branding is integral to how they present themselves to fans, attract sponsors, and project the team's <strike>goals</strike> values. <strike>When done well, it can foster long</strike> <strike>-term loyalty</strike> A strong, consistent brand can build legacy and loyalty, but for teams that struggle to deliver consistent results, branding is a bigger part of what they have to rely on. When performance slips, sponsors pull out, media attention fades, and the <strike>team's public image</strike> brand itself is weak. In these situations, the damage is about more than losing races, <strike>but a lack of clear direction</strike> but about losing control of the narrative that defines who the team is.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-7">
      A good example of this phenomenon is the Arrows Grand Prix International team where despite its long presence in Formula 1, <strike>never managed to</strike> struggled to establish a <strike>memorable or cohesive</strike> lasting brand identity. Formed in 1978, Arrows competed in over 300 Grands Prix but failed to secure a single win. While some mid-field teams have built strong branding through national identity, driver personalities, or innovation, Arrows lacked a unifying narrative or visual identity that would make them stand out₄. Their <strike>car colors and designs</strike> liveries changed frequently, often caused by short-term sponsor arrangements rather than a long-term brand visionᶠᶦᵍ⁴. <strike>Without sustained success or branding</strike> Lacking both on-track success and good marketing, Arrows came across as generic and forgettable. By the early 2000s, financial instability and <strike>inconsistent</strike> poor results left the team <strike>vulnerable</strike> rapidly declining. Sponsorship deals fell through, debts mounted, and by 2002, the team <strike>was forced to</strike> had no choice but to withdraw from the sport₅. Despite a 25 year run in Formula 1, Arrows left little behind in terms of brand legacy, proving that <strike>lasting</strike><strike> presence doesn't guarantee lasting impact</strike> even decades of time isn't enough in a sport where brand and identity are as important as results.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-8">
      The collapse of Arrows defines a larger truth in F1, without a distinctive and well-managed brand, teams struggle to stay relevant. This is especially true when there isn't on track success to fall back on. <strike>This is illustrated even more so</strike> This was even more apparent in the <strike>brief story</strike> case of Life Racing Engines₆. Founded by Ernesto Vita₇, the team entered the 1990 season with no motorsport background and a weak brand identity.  Vita's poor branding decisions <strike>positioned the project</strike> made the team seem more like a vanity project than a serious competitor, preventing him from attracting investors or sponsors. Rather than establishing credibility through partnerships, or demonstrating the engine's potential, Vita <strike>gambled everything on</strike> built the entire team's identity around his unproven W12 engine₈, only for it to be half as powerful as <strike>Honda and Ferrari</strike> its competitors₉. Their car was <strike>unable to complete</strike><strike> qualifying laps</strike> not equipped for the speed required in F1 and the car became infamousᶠᶦᵍ⁵. By tying the <strike>team's entire identity</strike> brand so closely to a <strike>flawed</strike> failing engine, Life lost any chance to attract external support. The lack of a strong identity or competitive performance meant the brand carried no trust or appeal. Ultimately, Life Racing Engines failed not only because of poor engineering, but because Vita's <strike>branding choices</strike> misjudgements₁₀ left the team without the investors needed to stay alive beyond its single season.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-9">
      The stories of Arrows and Life Racing Engines, emphasize <strike>the importance of</strike> that branding is not just decoration, but <strike>foundational</strike> essential to survival. Teams that can rely on their identity to last through setbacks, secure sponsorship, and maintain fan engagement <strike>through challenging periods</strike> will ultimately survive longer than one that can't. Without that foundation, even teams with history risk fading into the background and losing their place on the grid.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-title-4"><strike>Chapter 2</strike> Reinvention through Rebranding</template>

    <template id="text-template-10">
      <strike>While some Formula 1 teams fade away</strike> Another fate of a declining team is a rebrand. Unlike defunct teams, rebranded teams often retain their infrastructure and staff but come into the new season with new names, sponsors, and visions. <strike>The </strike><strike>rebrand can preserve a team's spot</strike> While this allows them to <strike>stay active in the </strike><strike>sport</strike> retain a place on the grid, it presents the <strike>challenge of maintaining a strong brand</strike><strike> identity during such a large change</strike> question of how to build loyalty and identity when the face of the team keeps changing. The answer often lies in how well the rebrand <strike>acknowledges</strike> leverages the team's past, using previous achievements and legacy to establish continuity. Teams with long histories, even if inconsistent, can draw on legacy branding to ground their new image. On the other hand, frequent rebranding, especially when the title sponsors change, can <strike>blur a team's identity</strike> cause a team's brand to be less reliable and trustworthy.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-11">
      The evolution of the Aston Martin F1 Team is <strike>a good example</strike> an effective case study in how long-term rebranding can reshape a team's identity without losing its foundation. <strike>Originally</strike> Founded in 1991 as Jordan Grand Prix₁₁, the team quickly earned recognition for its bright yellow cars and the charismatic leadership of Eddie Jordan. <strike>The team achieved moderate success</strike> Although the team had a handful of podiums and wins, <strike>the team changed hands</strike> the team underwent several ownership and identity changes over the next two decades changing from Midland to Spyker, and then later Force Indiaᶠᶦᵍ⁶. Each <strike>iteration brought a new brand identity</strike> new team had vastly different approaches to the brand identity. Midland₁₂ adopted a more corporate and impersonal <strike>identity</strike> image, Spyker₁₃ <strike>as a Dutch team, was orange</strike><strike> branded</strike> leaned into their Dutch nationalism with a bold orange liveryᶠᶦᵍ⁷, and Force India, followed by Racing Point₁₄, became known for its eye-catching pink carsᶠᶦᵍ⁸. <strike>Despite these shifts, the</strike><strike> team retained</strike> Throughout all these changes, however, the team's operations remained in Silverstone, crucially maintaining continuity behind the scenes. In 2021, Lawrence Stroll <strike>rebranded the team</strike> brought the well known Aston Martin name to the sport, aligning the team with a legacy in motorsport and a luxury image already tied to the companyᶠᶦᵍ⁹. <strike>The historical green and the sleek brand </strike><strike>association allowed the team to have both modern and historical prestige.</strike>₁₅ The well known <strike>car company</strike> name allows new fans to feel a sense of familiarity with a new team, and helps long time motorsport fans feel like the team exemplifies their values.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-12">
      A similar example is the Sauber F1 team <strike>as an example of brand evolution without </strike><strike>losing its core identity</strike> which has undergone numerous rebrands₁₆ yet continues to operate from its Swiss base since the early 1990s. <strike>Starting as an independent </strike><strike>constructor</strike> Sauber started as a private team and was eventually acquired by BMW to become a works team₁₇, <strike>meaning owned and operated by a major car</strike><strike></strike> manufacturer,</strike> in the mid-2000s. The partnership lasted a few years until BMW's exit and Sauber became independent yet again until 2017. They established a partnership with Alfa Romeoᶠᶦᵍ¹⁰, marking the iconic brand's comeback to Formula 1 after an absence of over 30 years. Each <strike>name change</strike> owner brought new colors, sponsors, and marketing angles, yet the team's DNA and operations remained rooted in Sauber's original foundationᶠᶦᵍ¹¹. Looking ahead to 2026, the team is set <strike>to once again rebrand the team</strike> for another change with Audi's official entry onto the grid. Unlike previous changes driven by partnerships or title sponsors, Audi's involvement is manufacturer-led <strike>aligned with a long-term vision</strike> and will tie into a broader, long-term identity campaign₁₈. In both Sauber's and Aston Martin's cases, their historical continuity has allowed each rebrand to build upon <strike>existing narratives</strike> existing legacies rather than starting from scratch.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-13">
      However, not every rebrand manages the same sense of continuity. Teams <strike>that are tied to</strike> whose brand relies on their title sponsor or are affected by regular changes in ownership often face challenges in establishing a stable identity₁₉. <strike>Fans and sponsors struggle to connect</strike> When branding elements like names, color schemes, and messaging shift from season to season, it becomes difficult for fans and sponsors to form a lasting connection₂₀. The lack of brand recognition weakens the image of the team and they become unimportant to fans, especially when they don't have the on-track results to compensate. Unlike legacy teams with history₂₁, <strike>newly branded teams</strike> shifting teams have to work harder to convince fans they are worthy. <strike>In a sport</strike> In F1 where history plays a central role in shaping brand loyalty the ability to rebrand successfully <strike>depends not just on new money or fresh paint</strike> doesn't just depend on sponsor money and pretty colors, but but on how effectively the new identity is connected to something enduring and authentic.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-title-5"><strike>Chapter 3</strike> New Audience, New Identity</template>

    <template id="text-template-14">
      For <strike>modern</strike> newer Formula 1 teams without the history behind them, <strike>there's urgency to capture audience attention</strike> branding has become less about legacy and more about relevance. As many younger fans are being drawn into the sport through social media or Netflix's Drive to Survive, teams are shifting branding strategies to <strike>match the media habits of</strike> Gen Z appeal to an audience that values personality and authenticity over decades of race wins₂₂. Older fans <strike>may feel</strike> are more likely to have a connection to <strike>heritage</strike> longer standing teams like Ferrari or Mercedes, whereas newer fans who come into the sport without that inherited loyalty <strike>rely on content that speaks to them</strike> support teams and drivers based on how well they align with their interests. This gives newer or recently rebranded teams the opportunity to build a following based on entertainment and fun identity-driven marketing. They can build their fan loyalty from scratch, but must overcome the challenge of <strike>speaking to the right crowd</strike> keeping it on trend and relatable to the constantly shifting and highly critical Gen Z.
    </template>

    <template id="text-template-15">
      The <strike>VCARB</strike> Visa Cash App Racing Bulls team, formerly <strike>known as</strike> under the name of Toro Rosso and AlphaTauri₂₃, is the most prominent example of a Gen Z focused strategy.
